Rename e.g. Surface2d.Function to SurfaceFunction2d, Surface.Function to SurfaceFunction?
-> flatter is often better, would give better type errors/hints instead of everything being shown as 'Function'

Support Point2d + VectorCurve2d
-> search for use cases of Curve2d.constant, including inside Curve2d module itself

Rewrite scripts in Haskell?
-> or Python?

Build out publishing workflow
- Collect wheels and publish combined package
  - might need intermediate step to merge Mac wheels into universal one, or just build universal one to start with?
- Docs publishing: generate-python-docs then e.g. 'cp -r opensolid-python/lib/docs/build ../../opensolid/opensolid.github.io/docs/0.1.1'
- Wheel publishing: uvx twine upload wheelhouse/*

C API: generate structs with *named* fields
-> have the struct be named as function_name_inputs, function_name_outputs etc.
-> can use this in Python too, to have named fields instead of 'field0' etc.

Improve Python bindings
- Allow Python classes to be represented by things other than pointers (e.g. plain float values for quantity types)
- Add magic IPython display functions to Curve2d, Drawing2d.Entity etc.
  -> using to-SVG (and eventually to-glTF) Haskell functions under the hood? ('display' functions?)
- Actual error types instead of strings
- Add _list_decode helper?
- Add support for 'intersects' operator (^)
  -> Also (&) for *intersection*?
- Add extra line to docstring mentioning tolerance, if one is required
- Remove leading underscores from helper functions, now that we have __all__ to control exports?
- Add support for enums (new Winding type?)

Try using Pandoc to convert from Haddock to reStructuredText?
-> or just write all doc comments in plain text...
-> or use specialized direct Haddock conversion - most flexible
   -> e.g. convert type/function names to correct target language casing

Support spaces / coordinate systems in bindings

Try generating C# bindings?

Try generating C++ bindings?

Sandbox executable to start generating Region2d medial axis curves and points?
-> need to be able to solve for medial axis of curve and *point* first

Implement 1D monotonic solving in Rust

Specialize xComponent etc. for Parametric cases

Move primitives to Primitives.hs

Use space1 ~ space2 instead of space ~ space_ everywhere

Refactor Estimate to return an error if convergence fails/stalls

Optimizations to try:
- cache expressions on Rust side (per thread?)
- refactor JIT code to directly generate 'primop' style code directly callable from Haskell
- add CMM wrappers around C functions so they can be directly used as primops

Implement Subtraction for UTCTime instead of having Duration.from function
-> also allow adding or subtracting Duration from a UTCTime to get another UTCTime
