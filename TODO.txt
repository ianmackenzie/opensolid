Have Plane3d inherit from PlaneOrientation3d and Frame3d inherit from Orientation3d in target languages
-> allow e.g. direction.on(plane) instead of having to write the awkward direction.on(plane.basis)

Replace Axis2d.normalDirection with Axis2d.[leftward,rightward]Direction
-> also offsetBy -> offsetLeftBy, offsetRightBy

In target languages: verbs are functions, nouns are properties?

Arc2d.from :: Point2d -> Point2d -> Angle -> Arc2d
Arc2d.leftTurn :: Point2d -> Point2d -> Arc2d
Arc2d.rightTurn :: Point2d -> Point2d -> Arc2d

Direction3d.[forward,backward,upward,downward,leftward,rightward] :: Direction3d
Direction3d.[forwardUpward,forwardDownward,forwardRightward,forwardLeftward] :: Angle -> Direction3d
Direction3d.[leftwardUpward,leftwardDownward,leftwardForward,leftwardBackward] :: Angle -> Direction3d
Direction3d.[rightwardUpward,rightwardDownward,rightwardForward,rightwardBackward] :: Angle -> Direction3d
Direction3d.[upwardForward,upwardBackward,upwardRightward,upwardLeftward] :: Angle -> Direction3d
-> also 'backward' and 'downward' versions, e.g. 'downwardForward' or 'backwardLeftward'?
  -> confusing! e.g. 'backwardLeftward'...which way does that turn, exactly?

Frame3d.oriented :: Direction3d -> Point3d -> Frame3d
Frame3d :: Point3d -> Orientation3d -> Frame3d

Use abscissae5 for Parameter.samples, 'rotated square' based on abscissae5 for SurfaceParameter.samples
-> nicely symmetric (5 points each, both cases include the center point)

Have separate rotateClockwiseAround and rotateCounterclockwiseAround functions everywhere?

General pattern:
- all types have constructors for cardinal directions
- Direction3d also has forwardUpward etc. for constructing non-cardinal directions

Maybe Axis3d, Plane3d, Frame3d constructors *all* take a point and a direction?
-> axis: point and direction
-> plane: point and normal direction
-> frame: point and forward direction
-> then use Plane3d.new and Frame3d.new for versions taking a basis argument?

Remove uses of Vector3d and Point3d constructors where possible
-> search for Point3d(Point3d) and Vector3d(Vector3d)

-> reduce duplication
-> cache normal direction

-> one canonical way of doing things...

Add support for named arguments in constructors
-> and overloading?

Re-add Line#d, Arc#d, Bezier#d etc. types with corresponding Curve#d.line, Curve#d.arc, Curve#d.bezier functions
-> in target languages, Line#d can be a *subclass* of Curve#d for convenience
  -> then don't need to expose Curve#d.line, Curve#d.arc etc. to target languages
-> move most curve constructors into the 'concrete' modules
-> also add Cylinder3d, Sphere3d, Circle2d, Disk3d (maybe Circle3d?) etc.
  -> useful as return type of e.g. Gear.bore or Bearing.bore function; Cylinder3d.startCap and endCap can return Disk3d...
-> also need UvLine, UvArc, UvBezier etc., but that seems OK...

Add Interface3d type
- defined by 'outward' and 'upward' direction ('localUpward'?)
- Interface3d.[upward,downward,leftward,rightward,forward,backward] point
- Interface3d.on plane point2d
- Interface3d.along axis distance
- Interface3d.flip interface
- Frame3d.mate interface1 interface2
  -> computes placement frame for object1
- Interface3d.rotateBy
  -> rotates around the outward axis
- Interface3d.plane interface
- Interface3d.axis interface
- Interface3d.frame interface

Add Text.Display class
- 'format' or similar function that returns a structured value defining how to display something (e.g. as a function call with arguments)
- Text.display for converting that to Text
- design the display data structure so it can also be used to generate valid 'to string' functions in target languages
  -> with correct function name convention etc.

Add random generation to API
-> Direction3d.random() : returns a random value directly
-> maybe eventually add support for generator objects with seeds and stepping?
   -> opensolid.Random class with init(int) function, nested Seed class..

Get Python docs publishing working
-> maybe just generate Sphinx-flavoured reStructuredText instead of tyring to use autodoc?
  -> full control over docs structure
  -> don't have to mess around with settings to get autodoc to be able to import 'opensolid' module
  -> one less dependency

Have SpurGear be a pure interface?
-> possibly add typeclass instance for '(Named "numTeeth" Int, Named "module" Length)' (anonymous record!)

Switch to providing an Axis3d instead of Axis2d for revolutions?
-> might be just fine to allow axes that do not in fact lie within the sketch plane
-> providing an absolute axis seems generally more readable than a relative one...
-> a bit tricky, since we need to check for profile curves that lie *on* the axis...
  -> convert everything to 3D and *then* check for curves lying on the axis?

Switch to FFI Name values being defined (and stored?) as camelCase
-> have functions to convert camelCase to snake_case or PascalCase
-> should then be able to use the same logic for converting function names in docs to match the target language

-> will require a bit of tweaking derivative logic, but hopefully doable...

-> represent as plain float value internally
-> defined in API as list of unit names and conversion factors, to create constructors/conversion functions like 'inches'/'inInches'

Implement generic Mesh class manually in each target language?
-> probably expose something like a MeshImpl class that just works with positions and vertex indices
-> expect target language to store actual vertices in its own array

Profile with ThreadScope to check for parallelization issues?

Implement arc length parameterization in C++

Update UV version in GitHub Actions

Refactor SurfaceParameter module
- Remove UvDirection in favour of just using 'Direction2d UvSpace' in the few places it's used
- Move UvPoint into its own module with UvPoint.random, UvPoint.samples
- Move UvBounds into its own module with UvBounds.unit (or unitSquare? if so, rename Region2d.unit)
- Change SurfaceParameter.random to generate a random SurfaceParameter value (U or V)

Have Units.Coercion implementations just call a type-specific 'coerce' function everywhere?
-> some places may not need Units.Coercion at all, should only be needed for arithmetic?

Make Point#d a newtype over Vector#d?
-> useful for bytecode evaluation code, evaluation functions can return Vector#d and then coerce to Point#d
-> consistent with Direction#d being a newtype over Vector#d
-> use Position#d as the internal constructor name?
-> similarly make Bounds#d a newtype over VectorBounds#d?

Add 'components'/'coordinates' functions to curve and surface function types
-> especially useful for constructing derivatives of function compositions

Rename CompiledFunction to Function.Compiled
-> or possibly Evaluator or similar?
  -> then might make sense to *not* implement Addition etc. for Evaluator, just use map2 (+) (+) (+) etc.

-> implicit argument in Haskell, treated just like tolerance (except it's not passed _through_ anywhere)
-> 'Convention.using Convention.yUp' (X left, Z forward), 'Convention.using Convention.zUp' (X right, Y forward)
-> Conventions: right handed, Y or Z up, no cardinal directions point downward or backward
    Convention.yUp (alias for xLeftwardYUpwardZForward)
    Convention.zUp (alias for xRightwardYForwardZUpward)
    Convention.xLeftwardYUpwardZForward
    Convention.xRightwardYForwardZUpward
    Convention.xForwardYLeftwardZUpward
    Convention.xForwardYUpwardZRightward

Switch to 'perfect' units coercion for curves and surface function types
-> can coerce Haskell functions!

Replace 'CompiledFunction.abstract' with 'compileImpl' where applicable

Review all 'sqrt', 'magnitude', 'direction' and 'tangentDirection' functions to ensure correct degeneracy removal
-> get rid of 'unsafeMagnitude' functions and 'NonZeroMagnitude' types

Try removing 'unitless ~ Unitless' constraints everywhere
-> maybe also 'uvPoint ~ UvPoint', 'uvSpace ~ UvSpace', 'uvCoordinates ~ UvCoordinates'

Try defining API in terms of generic units and then *separately* a list of supported units?
-> C API could then just work on Float values
-> nicer mapping to F# (or potentially other languages with sufficiently powerful type systems that can represent units reasonably nicely)
-> could expose current 'flat' structure as convenience layer for languages that don't have good unit support (most of them)

Add Region2d.regularPolygon which takes number of sides and incircle diameter
-> corresponds to width across flats for polygons with even numbers of sides...
-> for polygon based on circumcircle: sample Curve2d.circle at N points:
   circle = Curve2d.circle point diameter
   Region2d.polygon [Curve2d.pointOn circle t | t <- Parameter.leading n]

Throw a Haskell exception for higher-order zeros in Curve solving
-> possibly also other truly 'exceptional' cases?
-> make sure to catch those exceptions in FFI...
-> probably still use a normal error type for second-or-higher order Curve2d intersections etc.
-> even Surface solving only solves for tangent roots though...
-> global rule that there should never be second or higher order intersection zeros/intersections?
  -> helps prevent constructing very complex third/fourth derivatives...

Ensure all quotient implementations use (p' / q) - (p / q) * (q' / q) form, to better support L'Hopital

Refactor Composition type parameter order to reflect . instead of >> use? (outer then inner)

Improve curve linearization to take first-order bounds and even just zeroth-order bounds into account

-> call that a 'Try a' or 'Attempt a' or similar?

Remove Curve2d.cornerArc now that e.g. Region2d.fillet exists?
-> also add Curve2d.fillet to fillet curves at their (single) intersection point?

Useful operations:

Add DirectionCurve2d.[rotateLeft,rotateRight] and use in Curve2d.offsetBy, Region2d.fillet

Add OpenSolid prefix to API modules

Remove Drawing2d.Resolution, *or* use it everywhere
-> maybe have 'OpenSolid' be a context manager? 'with OpenSolid(tolerance=..., resolution=...):' etc.
  -> could support just setting tolerance *or* resolution at a time
  -> could also set default display units (tolerance, output_resolution, display_units...)

Add Linear transformation types?
-> can only be used for vector types
-> rename Affine to Positioned or Positional similar?

Add Curve2d.centerPoint function?
-> check that evaluating center point from 3-point Gaussian quadrature points gives the same result, then return result for t=0.5
-> maybe other queries like Surface3d.normalDirection (useful for querying for e.g. "back face")

Reconsider having Axis2d.u, Point2d.uv etc. specialized constants/constructors?
-> maybe even move UvSpace into main CoordinateSystem module...and remove UvPoint etc. type aliases?
-> simpler to just use Point2d constructor directly, instead of Point2d.uv

Have one generic Error type for Body3d construction?
-> or have separate error types, and e.g. map BoundedBy.Error to Extruded.Error by calling internalError for 'impossible' errors

Steiner point optimization: discard UV subdomains that touch an outer boundary of the overall domain bounding box but *don't* touch a boundary curve/edge
-> useful for thin regions, e.g. those resulting from domain stretching...

Search for Vector#d.unit calls and implement direct operations on Direction#d values directly where possible

Use direct constructors for primitives in more places

-> rework overlap detection to be based on G2 continuity?

Have Domain.samplingPoints etc. return a 'Result InfiniteRecursion (NonEmpty Float)'?

Refactor Surface3d.toMesh to match Body3d

Meshing improvements:
- Scale UV domain based on relative fuu and fvv magnitudes, so that e.g. cylinder gets triangulated as strip
- Or perhaps better: scale UV domain domain based on relative fu and fv magnitudes, to get better triangle aspect ratios?
- Properly handle UV domains with extreme aspect ratios: take overall bounds and have initial step that splits into square-ish segments?

Support Point3d + VectorSurfaceFunction3d -> SurfaceFunction3d

Have single Linearization module with curveError and surfaceError functions?

Add transformBy to all curve, surface and surface function types
-> then search for transformByImpl instances to see if they can be updated to use transformBy instead of Transformed constructors

- recursively search for bisection value to balance two sub-lists?

Rewrite scripts in Haskell?
-> or Python?
  -> Haskell better, might have multiple target languages but Haskell will still be primary for a long time...
-> first up: regenerating hie.yaml to use 'flib' for opensolid-ffi
  -> perhaps also combined script to add a new test executable and update hie.yaml

C API: generate structs with *named* fields
-> have the struct be named as function_name_inputs, function_name_outputs etc.
-> can use this in Python too, to have named fields instead of 'field0' etc.

Improve Python bindings
- Make axes callable by a Length to give a point?
- Add magic IPython display functions to Curve2d, Drawing2d.Entity etc.
  -> using to-SVG (and eventually to-glTF) Haskell functions under the hood? ('display' functions?)
- Actual error types instead of strings
- Add _list_decode helper?
- Add support for 'intersects' operator (^)
  -> Also (&) for *intersection*?
- Add extra line to docstring mentioning tolerance, if one is required
- Remove leading underscores from helper functions, now that we have __all__ to control exports?
- Add support for enums (new Winding type?)
- Add support for composition (special support for languages that support callable objects?)

Try using Pandoc to convert from Haddock to reStructuredText?
-> or just write all doc comments in plain text...
-> or use specialized direct Haddock conversion - most flexible
   -> e.g. convert type/function names to correct target language casing

-> or perhaps a few different options for specifying canvas: Drawing2d.bounds, Drawing2d.padding etc.

Support spaces / coordinate systems in bindings?

Try generating C# bindings?

Try generating Dart bindings?

Add extension method to tuple types in target languages that support them:
  -> (start, end).steps(10) <-- nicely symmetric with Parameter.steps(10)
  -> (start, end).interpolate(0.3)
